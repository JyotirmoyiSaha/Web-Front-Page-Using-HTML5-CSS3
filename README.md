# Web-Front-Page-Using-HTML5-CSS3
 In this project, I just build how to make a website front page using HTML and CSS.  First we have a Text logo and beautiful navigation menu. Then we have contents in 2 columns, in the left column there is a image and you can see when I move cursor over this image, it becomes back and white image. In the right column there are some text and some social media icons. When We move cursor over this icon, it moves up very smoothly and the icon and background color is changing.
